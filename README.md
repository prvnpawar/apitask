Hi Praveen,

Please build a simple webservice that takes a POST request to add data into a PostgreSQL database. The database credentials are as below:

Database server: balarama.db.elephantsql.com

Username: klftcrhk

database name: klftcrhk

password: bCooJNNyIIuTfawSSYjEIR8y7QvLsem2

Database has only three columns

--userId (primary key)

--username

--name

Expectation
-- The API should sanitize POST requests and insert into the database and return the userId as JSON response.

If you have any further question, pleasse let me know.

Best Regards,
Vivek Manjunath
